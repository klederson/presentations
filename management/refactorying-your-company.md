Management, CTO, 

# Title
Un-dooming IT - a CTO survival manual of how to save your company before it's too late.

# Short
In this talk I'll talk about my personal experience "refactoring" the IT department in a pragmatic way in order to have a motivating environment, challenging and productive not only by having the right technology and good practices but also implementing a culture change.

# Description
It's often common in nowdays find comapanies/startups where they are very strongly based on IT but with a weak IT department (sometimes almost inexistent).

In this talk I'd like to show that IT is not about having one or many developers executing your project but a whole ecosystem, architecture, strategic vision over your app, site or product, aligned with good practices, scalability and mostly the business itself.

Based on personal experiences Ill talk a little bit about some mesures I had to take and how we managed to change - in a short period of time - not only IT's role in the company but also how this reflected in the product quality and the other departments.
